# TensorFlow-Cheat-Sheet
TensorFlow is an open-source software library for highperformance numerical computation. Its flexible architecture enables to easily deploy computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs), as well as mobile and edge devices, desktops, and clusters of servers. TensorFlow comes with strong support for machine learning and deep learning.

### Layers

| Flatten | `tf.keras.layers.Flatten()`                             | Flatten is used to flatten the input. For example, if flatten is applied to layer having input shape as (batch­_size, 2,2), then the output shape of the layer will be (batch­_size, 4) |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dense   | `tf.keras.layers.Dense(units, activation, input_shape)` |                                                              |
