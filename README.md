# TensorFlow-Cheat-Sheet
TensorFlow is an open-source software library for highperformance numerical computation. Its flexible architecture enables to easily deploy computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs), as well as mobile and edge devices, desktops, and clusters of servers. TensorFlow comes with strong support for machine learning and deep learning.

### Layers

| Layers       | Code                                                         | Usage                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dense        | `tf.keras.layers.Dense(units, activation, input_shape)`      | Dense layer is the regular deeply connected neural network layer. It is most common and frequently used layer. |
| Flatten      | `tf.keras.layers.Flatten()`                                  | Flatten is used to flatten the input. For example, if flatten is applied to layer having input shape as (batch­_size, 2,2), then the output shape of the layer will be (batch­_size, 4) |
| Conv2D       | `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, activation, input_shape)` | Filter for two-di­men­sional image data                      |
| MaxPooling2D | `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(pool_size)`                          | Max pooling for two-di­men­sional image data                 |
|              |                                                              |                                                              |
|              |                                                              |                                                              |

|              |                                                              |                                                              |
|              |                                                              |                                                              |
